        <p>Hi there, I'm David Chiu.</p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Dallas, TX, where I earned both my undergraduate and
          graduate degrees in Arts and Technology at the University of Texas at
          Dallas. I can be described as a lover of puzzles and logic-based
          anything, whether it be in a game, part of the job, or just another
          instance of daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy traveling to new places, especially to places that are
          relatively untouched by modern city development and/or are far away
          (distance-wise) from the familiar. I also like to play tabletop card
          games like Magic: the Gathering and watch videos of all sorts, ranging
          from documentaries to gameplay footage to independently made
          animations.
